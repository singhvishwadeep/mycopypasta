      <p>Aukaat. The internet is eating your memory, but something better is taking its place

Your money is a huge part of your life. It can determine what you can do and where you can go. 
Learning how to manage your money the right way is an important step toward taking control of your life. 
Understand where your money is coming from, where it's going to, and how to make sure that the way you manage 
your money falls in line with the values that matter most to you.

As soon as you start spending your own money, it’s time to start tracking your spending so that you can create 
and follow a personal budget. Tracking your spending, while sometimes tedious, is the best way to find out exactly 
where your money is going.</p>

      <p> My Copy-Pasta. The internet is eating your memory, but something better is taking its place

You sometime wishes, you could paste and save your copied information.

This creation is inspired by several thoughts. It is the idea of ideas. In the years since the world started 
going digital, one of the big changes has been that we don’t need to remember very much. As we come across with 
different information daily, but, we donot keep track of them. You cannot trust on human mind for storing the 
information for longer time. Here, we are providing you this platform so that you can save your information like 
daily find outs, logics in your own words and understanding, important web links or bookmarks, important programming 
syntaxes/uses, manuals, definitions, important dates, and many other things.</p>
